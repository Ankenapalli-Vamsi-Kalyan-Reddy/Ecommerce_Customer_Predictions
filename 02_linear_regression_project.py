# Linear Regression Project


## Imports
** Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib,and seaborn. Then set %matplotlib inline
(You'll import sklearn as you need it.)**
"""

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

"""## Get the Data

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

** Read in the Ecommerce Customers csv file as a DataFrame called customers.**
"""

customers = pd.read_csv('Ecommerce Customers')

"""**Check the head of customers, and check out its info() and describe() methods.**"""

customers.head()



customers.describe()



customers.info()



"""## Exploratory Data Analysis

**Let's explore the data!**

For the rest of the exercise we'll only be using the numerical data of the csv file.
___
**Use seaborn to create a jointplot to compare the Time on Website and Yearly Amount Spent columns. Does the correlation make sense?**
"""

sns.jointplot(x='Time on Website', y='Yearly Amount Spent', data = customers)



"""** Do the same but with the Time on App column instead. **"""

sns.jointplot(x='Time on App', y='Yearly Amount Spent', data = customers)



"""** Use jointplot to create a 2D hex bin plot comparing Time on App and Length of Membership.**"""

sns.jointplot(x='Time on App', y='Length of Membership', data = customers, kind='hex')



"""**Let's explore these types of relationships across the entire data set. Use [pairplot](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/axis_grids.html#plotting-pairwise-relationships-with-pairgrid-and-pairplot) to recreate the plot below.(Don't worry about the the colors)**"""

sns.pairplot(customers)



"""**Based off this plot what looks to be the most correlated feature with Yearly Amount Spent?**"""



"""**Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of  Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership. **"""

sns.lmplot(x='Yearly Amount Spent', y='Length of Membership', data=customers)



"""## Training and Testing Data

Now that we've explored the data a bit, let's go ahead and split the data into training and testing sets.
** Set a variable X equal to the numerical features of the customers and a variable y equal to the "Yearly Amount Spent" column. **

customers.columns

X = customers[['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']]
